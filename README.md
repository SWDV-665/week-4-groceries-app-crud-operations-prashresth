By end of this week, the Groceries app should be able to perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. For our week 4 assignment, complete the following steps:



Access the GitHub Classroom. Here is the GitHub Classroom assignment link: https://classroom.github.com/a/RSC0KVuO (Links to an external site.).
As discussed in the video, the current status of the app should do the CRUD operation.
Capture the screenshots of each tab or screencast walking through the flow of each tab.
Create a folder called 'screenshots' or 'screencasts' and depending on what you generate. It is OK to have both screenshots and screencasts.
Commit the generated screenshots or screencasts files in the GitHub assignment repo.
